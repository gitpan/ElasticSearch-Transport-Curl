NAME
    ElasticSearch::Transport::Curl - A libcurl based HTTP backend for
    ElasticSearch

VERSION
    version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
        use ElasticSearch;
        my $e = ElasticSearch->new(
            servers     => 'search.foo.com:9200',
            transport   => 'curl',
            timeout     => '10',
        );

DESCRIPTION
    ElasticSearch::Transport::Curl uses WWW::Curl and thus libcurl
    <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/> to talk to ElasticSearch over HTTP.

    This is by far the fastest HTTP backend - 60% faster than the next
    fastest ElasticSearch::Transport::HTTPTiny, but does require a C
    compiler.
