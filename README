NAME
    ElasticSearch::Transport::Curl - DEPRECATED: A libcurl based HTTP
    backend for ElasticSearch

VERSION
    version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
        use ElasticSearch;
        my $e = ElasticSearch->new(
            servers     => 'search.foo.com:9200',
            transport   => 'curl',
            timeout     => '10',
        );

DESCRIPTION
    THIS MODULE IS DEPRECATED.

    ************************************************************************
    ******

    Because of the name clash between ElasticSearch.pm and Elasticsearch.pm
    the official Perl client is now called: Search::Elasticsearch.

    See https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-perl/issues/20 for
    details.

    This distribution will be removed from CPAN in 2015. Please update your
    code.

    ************************************************************************
    ******

    ElasticSearch::Transport::Curl uses WWW::Curl and thus libcurl
    <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/> to talk to ElasticSearch over HTTP.

    This is by far the fastest HTTP backend - 60% faster than the next
    fastest ElasticSearch::Transport::HTTPTiny, but does require a C
    compiler.
